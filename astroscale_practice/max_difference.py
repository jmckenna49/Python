# Implement the following functions:

# disallow_negatives(num: int) -> int that takes an integer and returns the integer if it is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, it should return 0.
# max_difference(nums: List[int]) -> int that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum difference between any two adjacent elements in the list, by subtracting the element on the right from the element on the left. In other words, it should return the maximum value of nums[i] - nums[i - 1] for all valid indices i.
# You may assume the output will always be a positive integer.
# Example: Given the list [10, 1, 3, 7], the maximum adjacent difference is 7 - 3 = 4.
# You may assume all input lists will have at least two elements.
