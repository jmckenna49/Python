# In this case you have the key as the objectType and the value as a suffix.
# For the camera we will set None as we want to use it to indicate Camera's should have no suffix
# Having a dictionary in this chunk of code is also more efficient than using a bunch of if, else if, and else statements because I can add more values and their keys which will make this code more efficient and faster.

# This variable down below will use the ls function in maya to list out what objects are currently and fully in the scene.
# We'll also need to make an if statement in case there isn't any objects in the scene as well.
# We should also get the full path to the object instead of just the name of the object.
# Long is a function in the Maya cmds library that will return the full path for the names of the objects.
# The other point of using Long is to also tell whether or not objects have a parent child relationship.

# Selection here is our vargin, I'm setting this equal to false currently to let the function know whether or not I would like to use this as an input.
